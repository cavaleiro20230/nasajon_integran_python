Modern Python API for Nasajon Integration


Thought for 3 seconds### Modern Python API for Nasajon Integration

I'll create a modern Python API using FastAPI to handle efficient data import and export between your application and Nasajon systems.

```typescriptreact project="nasajon-integration-api"
...
```

## Key Features of the Python Nasajon Integration API

This modern Python API provides a robust solution for integrating with Nasajon systems, with the following features:

1. **FastAPI-based RESTful Endpoints**:

1. Export data to Nasajon
2. Import data from Nasajon
3. Import data from files
4. Check integration job status



2. **Asynchronous Processing with Celery**:

1. All integration operations run asynchronously via Celery tasks
2. Redis as message broker for reliable task queuing
3. Job status tracking with unique job IDs



3. **Robust Error Handling**:

1. Comprehensive exception handling
2. Detailed error messages and structured logging
3. Global exception handler for consistent error responses



4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:

1. Scheduled cleanup of stuck jobs
2. Automatic purging of old completed jobs
3. Detailed logging for troubleshooting



5. **Security**:

1. API key authentication
2. Configurable timeouts and connection settings
3. Environment-based configuration



6. **Documentation**:

1. Swagger/OpenAPI integration for API documentation
2. Detailed API operation descriptions



7. **Containerization**:

1. Docker and Docker Compose setup for easy deployment
2. Separate containers for API, worker, scheduler, database, and Redis





## Implementation Details

The API is built using FastAPI with a clean, modular architecture:

- **Routes Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and integration operations
- **Repository Layer**: Manages data persistence with SQLAlchemy
- **Client Layer**: Handles communication with Nasajon systems using aiohttp
- **Task Layer**: Manages asynchronous processing with Celery


The application uses PostgreSQL for data storage and Redis for task queuing, all containerized for easy deployment.

## Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the environment variables
2. Run the application using Docker Compose:

```plaintext
docker-compose up -d
```




Once running, you can access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs` to explore and test the API endpoints.
